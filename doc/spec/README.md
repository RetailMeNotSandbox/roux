# Roux

A roux is a mixture of butter and flour that provides the base for many sauces,
including the French mother sauces.

In the same way, the Roux ecosystem is a set of ingredients, tools, and an app
that is a base for scalable development of front-end assets.

It consists of:

* pantries of ingredients,
* a set of npm modules to install and reference ingredients in your app,
* and an app, [Béchamel][], to view ingredients and their documentation.
